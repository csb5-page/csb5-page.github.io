title: Globally prevalent gut phage families from long-read metagenomics
description: Via analyzing a Singaporean gut microbiome cohort using long-read sequencing, we uncovered globally highly prevalent yet novel gut phage families, many of which infect Firmicutes hosts, have broad host range, and actively replicate in the gut.

The human gut microbiome harbors an immense diversity of bacteriophages (phages) — viruses that infect bacteria — but their diversity and function remain under-characterized. Leveraging long-read metagenomics, we mapped gut phage diversity in a Singaporean cohort (n=109), and performed proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing and sequencing of viral-like particles (VLPs) to paint a comprehensive picture of who they infect and their replication lifestyles.

We found *drastically* improved viral recovery with the addition of long-read sequencing, which is often due to viral genomes being frequently fragmented in short-read assemblies.

Viral family-level clustering revealed that almost all of the most prevalent phage families in this cohort have not been described before (11 of the top 12).

A first guess is that phage clades are population-specific and lurk only within Singaporean microbiomes. Surprisingly, many of these families are in fact highly prevalent globally (>20%)!

Many of these families have broad Firmicutes host ranges; these so-called GuFi phages highlight how much we don't yet know about phage diversity in the gut microbiome.

Intriguingly, while many of these families are temperate, meaning they spend part of their life cycle in a dormant state, we find that some frequently induce and actively replicate.

Our efforts have also let to the induction and TEM imaging of several of these families.

We studied many factors that could explain the high prevalence of these families, including the presence of diversity generating retroelements (DGRs), which aid in host range expansion and immune evasion.

Our study emphasizes the utility of long reads for viral discovery, and highlights globally prevalent phage clades that likely have a greater impact in the gut microbiome than previously appreciated.
