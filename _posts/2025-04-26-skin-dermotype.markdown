Which skin microbiome type do you have ðŸ¤” Super thrilled to share our exciting work from the Asian Skin Microbiome Program! We collected >3,500 skin samples, built metagenomic libraries w/ >70 billion reads and >10TB of data to study population heterogeneity in skin microbiome (200 adults, 18 sites). 

Surveying this unpredecented scale of skin microbiome samples, we observed that the skin microbiome is organized into distinct "dermotypes" unique to each skin site! In the underarm alone, we identified 5 distinct dermotypes. Using machine learning, we can predict these dermotypes with just five key microbial species.

Whatâ€™s even more fascinating? Dermotypes are highly coordinated across different parts of the body. Left and right sides mirror each other closely â€” pointing to systematic coordinations.

You might ask - why do these skin microbiome dermotypes emerge and does it matter to our skin health? ðŸ¤” We observed that microbes behave differently depending on dermotype, forming unique co-occurrence networks. Culture-based experiments further suggest oxygen gradients and nutrient availability drive these patterns.

Dermotypes arenâ€™t just scientific curiosities â€” they matter for health. Theyâ€™re linked to host factors like ethnicity, gender, and skincare habits. Some dermotypes even correlate with skin sensitivity, itch, and eczema risk, offering new opportunities for patient stratification and treatment innovation.

Exciting times ahead as we continue unraveling how diverse factors sculpt the skin microbiome, and how dermotypes influence skin health!
