*Sarah, the head chef, helped us cook our own pasta!*

After devouring our cooked pasta, we treated ourselves to some durian! We tried out the D88 (XO), D13 (Red Prawn), Black Thorn and MSW varieties.

Not only do we like to eat durian, but we also like to [sequence it too](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3972#Sec9).


Thanks Jon for organizing, and thanks everyone for joining and helping out! ðŸ“¸ A perfect day captured by Zhenhao, Jon, and Seeu Si.
