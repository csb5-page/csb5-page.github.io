Finding consensus of multiple DNA sequences has been an important and well-studied problem. Fast and accurate algorithms are critical in the workflow of (metagenomic) genome assembly, variant calling, and most recently, *trace reconstruction* in DNA data storage systems.

*Typical workflow of a DNA data storage system.*

Current reconstruction algorithms typically rely on pairwise or multiple sequence alignment, whose results depend heavily on the chosen alignment scoring metrics.

*Different scoring metrics may yield different MSA.*

However, it is well known that the sequencing error rate may vary within each read and across different datasets [[1]](#1). Finding the optimal scoring scheme that accommodates all these variations is not easy.

We therefore propose a new problem definition. Instead of assuming the error rates and finding the optimal alignment, we imagine that the sequences are observations of an unknown generative model, and try to **predict the most probable next observation of the model**.

*The most probable next observation is regarded as the consensus.*

In this work, we assume the model to be a *k*-th order Markov chain, whose parameters can be easily learned via *k*-mer counting. The parameters essentially encodes the **position-specific error rates**, making the alignment highly accurate. A novel algorithm, *Bidirectional Beam Search* (BBS), is used to infer the most probable output.

Our algorithm takes linear time with respect to the length of the consensus, making it asymptotically faster than the other algorithms, while achieving top-tier accuracy.

Finally, the *k*-th order Markov chain also outputs a joint probability of observing the consensus sequence, which can be used to calculate a confidence score to judge the correctness of output consensus sequence, aiding in building a fast and reliable consensus finding workflow.
