My work focuses on using high-throughput techniques to uncover and study microbial species. With countless species still waiting to be discovered, itâ€™s truly exciting to contribute to efforts that expand our understanding of the hidden diversity of microbial communities. Outside the lab, I enjoy spending time with friends and family over good food and conversation.
