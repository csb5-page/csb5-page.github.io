I am a microbiome scientist passionate about reimagining how we live in a microbial world. Our lab has students and researchers from diverse backgrounds, celebrating each other's successes, and helping the team do the most exciting science that impacts human and environmenal health. I love reading realistic science fiction stories, playing strategy games and almost all racquet sports (except those whose names end with the word "ball").
