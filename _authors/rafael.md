Hi there! I'm interested in using my computer science skills, especially in artificial intelligence, to solve fascinating problems in biology, with a current focus on microbiology. I'm always happy to discuss science and explore collaborations, so please feel free to reach out if you are interested. When I'm not working, I enjoy playing football (I care more about nutmegs than scoring goals) and am passionate about cooking honest, flavorful food, the kind that values taste over presentation.
