I explore how microbial communities on the skin and in the gut influence human health with a focus on skin-related illnesses and the role of the gut microbiome in cardiovascular disease. I am keen in uncovering how microbial interactions shape health outcomes and how these insights can guide future healthcare strategies. Outside the lab, I enjoy traveling and caring for my growing collection of plants, which has turned my room into a mini forest.
