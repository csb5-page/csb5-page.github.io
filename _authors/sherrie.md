My current work focuses on studying the skin microbiome, particularly in individiuals with atopic dermatitis and acne. A bulk of my time is spent in the lab extracting DNA from samples, trying to navigate excel and doing a little bit of bioinformatics work. Outside of the lab, I like to go bouldering and taking care of my herb plants.
