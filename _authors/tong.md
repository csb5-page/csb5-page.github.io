An aspiring software craftsman with a passion for building high-quality software that makes an impact in the healthcare industry through solid software engineering practices. My goal is to see what I create being used to improve people's lives. Outside of work, I enjoy reading everything from detective novels to textbooks on software engineering and architecture, exploring new tech topics, exercising, eating, and sleeping!
